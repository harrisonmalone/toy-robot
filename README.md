# Toy Robot

This is a Toy Robot application that runs in the browser. It accepts input in a `textarea` and returns coordinates based on where the robot was instructed to move.

Input should be provided in the following format:

```
PLACE 0,0,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
```

where a robot must be placed before it can move and pivot.
